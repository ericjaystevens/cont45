        <h1>Level 1</h1>
        <p>
            Level 1 sets up some two cornerstone routines and you will experiment with habits and practice tracking them.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can and should bring all your existing daily habits, you can track them if you'd like but they don't count as credit for moving forward.
        </p>
        <h2>Level 1 Kickoff</h2>
        <p>
            Get a paper journal to track your progress and use for reflections. Write down all your existing daily habits in your journal.
        </p>
        <h2> Minimum Viable Routines </h2>
        <p>
            See level 0 for instructions on setting up your morning and end-of-day routines. If you have already gone through level 0, just keep up and track your progress.
        </p>
        <h2>Create a network of 45ers</h2>
        <p> 
            Cont.45 values community involvement, so reach out to those around you and find out if anyone wants to run the program with you.  Start a group chat with anyone who wants to join in.
        </p>
