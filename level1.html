        <h1>level 1</h1>
        <p>Level 1 sets up some two cornerstone routines and has your experiment with habits and practice tracking them.</p>
        <p>You can and should bring all your existing daily habits, you can track them if you'd like but they don't count as credit for moving forward.</p>
        <h2>Level 1 Kickoff</h2>
        <p>Get a paper journal to track your progress and use for reflections.</p>
        <p>Write down all your existing daily habits in your journal.</p>

        <h2> Minimum Viable Routines </h2>
        <p>
            see level 0 for instructions on setting up your morning and end of day routines. If you have already gone through level 0, just keep up and track your progress. 
        </p>
        <h2>Create a network of 45ers</h2>
        <p> 
            Cont.45 values community involvement, so reach out to those around you and find out if anyone wants to run the program with you. Start a group chat with anyone who want to join in.
