        <h1>Level 0 (Optional 10 days)</h1>
        <p>
            Level 0 is if you really want to ease into the program. It gives you the chance to read the material and mentally prepare for the journey ahead. It's here if you need it, but entirely optional, and if you're ready to jump in just start at level 1.
        <p>
            Level 0 requires you to practice 2 routines. They are so simple we call them the minimum viable routines or MVRs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first MVR is your end of Day routine (MVR:EOD). All you need to do is set a daily evening alarm and ensure you lay out your clothes for the next day either before or right after that alarm goes off.
        </p><p>
            The second MVR is your Start of Day routine (MVR:SOD). This just involves before you start your day taking a single minute of mindfulness practice. If you're new to mindfulness I recommend you start by simply sitting and focusing on your breathing. You can research and implement other technics and find one that works for you.
