        <h1>The Continuous 45 Program</h1>
        <p>
            Continuous 45 (shortened to cont.45) is an iterative plan for self-improvement that focuses on fostering new habits and using structure to be more intentional.
        </p><p>
            Each level lasts 45 days. There are 10 levels, and each level except the first and last has a set of baseline and progressing objects. If you fall below the baseline objectives, you will move back a level, and if you exceed the progressive objective, you will move up a level.
        </p><p>
            The levels are intended to start off easy and progressively get more challenging as you build your discipline, tools, and understanding of your potential.
        </p><p>   
            Cont.45 uses experimentation, self-reflection, and AI to help you better customize the program templates to meet your goals and values.
        </p><p>
            You're encouraged and empowered to adjust rules, earn excused days off, and push yourself just the right amount.You will wholistically make improvements to each area of your life so that you more positively impact on those you love and the world around you.
        </p><p>    
            Levels 0-3 will build a foundation of habits and routines.  3-6 (overlap is intentional) will focus on your health and responsibilities. 6-9 will emphasize your ability to make desired changes in yourself and the communities you impact. Level 10 will ensure your ability to build and implement continuously improving systems.
