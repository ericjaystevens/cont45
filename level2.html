        <h1>Level 2</h1> 
        <p>This level will start building on your SOD and EOD MVA's as such you may need to adjust the timing for them. The expectation at this point is both will still be able to be completed in under 10 minutes.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Level 2 Kickoff</h2>
        
        <p>Select a calendering system. This can be digital or physical. This will give you a place to plan ahead</p> 
        
        <h2> Dailies </h2>
        <p>select 3-5 habits of the level1 15 to do daily for the rest of your life. You can customize them (make them easier or harder). This is the start of your dailies. This is a checklist you will complete each day. It will grow over time. You can look at your dailies during your MVR:SOD, then check them off when you complete them, or at your MVR:EOD.
        </p>
        <p>
        For each daily you should think about when and how you will make sure to do this habit daily and write it down in your journal.
    </p><p>
        You can optionally link these habits to your MVA's just make sure you plan for the extra time. 
        </p>
        <h3>primary task</h3> 
        <p>
        add the primary task to your 4ever45 routine. This means at your MRA:EOD write down an item you would like to complete the next day that you expect will take 20 minutes or less. If its longer try to break it up into the smaller task that moves you towards your objective, for example if i wanted to replace my toilet, my Primary task would be to buy a toilet, or perhaps to research toilets. Even if I don't finish the toilet replacement that day I still get credit for completing my primary task.
    </p><p>
        During my MVR:SOD review your primary task and then when your MVR:EOD happens record if you completed it or not, and then start the process all over again.
    </p><p>
        primary tasks should be something important but doesn't need to be the most important thing, just the thing you are 100% committed to finishing by the following day. If a primary action needs to be done on a certain date put it on your calender.
    </p>
        <h3> Plan your meals</h3>
        <p>
        During your MVA:EOD think about what you will eat for each of your meals the next day and write them down. You don't have to stick to your plan, so don't feel pressure to get it right. Just think through your options and think about what makes sense to you. This will help you practice being more intentional with your food. If your advanced or want and additional challenge stay 3-7 days ahead with your meal planning and use a calendar to track.
    </p><p>
        If for some reason meal planning doesn't make sense for you (say your a child or in an environment where you meals are provided for you). Find another daily decision to replace with advanced planning.
    </p>
        <h3>Increased Mindfulness practice </h3>
        <p>
        3-6 min of mindfulness practice a day, this can be an increase to your MVR:SOD 1 minute or can be done at a different planned time trough out the day. Add completion to your dailies 
    </p>
